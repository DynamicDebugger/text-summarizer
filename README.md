# Text Summarization Web Application

## Overview

This project is a text summarization web application developed using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The application allows users to input text and receive concise summaries, making it easier to understand lengthy articles, papers, or any substantial body of text.

## Features

- **NLP-Based Summarization**: Utilizes advanced NLP algorithms to generate summaries.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Flask, providing a simple and intuitive web interface for users.
- **Customizable Input**: Users can input any text and receive a summary tailored to the input content.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Main programming language.
- **Flask**: Web framework for creating the web interface.
- **NLP Libraries**: Libraries such as NLTK, SpaCy, or Transformers for text analysis and summarization.
